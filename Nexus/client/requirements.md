## Packages
framer-motion | Complex animations for the cyberpunk interface (slide-in panels, glitch effects)
date-fns | Formatting timestamps for logs and last seen status
recharts | Visualization of log activity and system metrics
clsx | Conditional class merging
tailwind-merge | Utility for merging tailwind classes safely

## Notes
The application requires a dark, cyberpunk/terminal aesthetic.
API endpoints defined in @shared/routes will be used for all data fetching.
AI generation endpoints for scripts and log analysis are expected to be slow, so loading states must be robust.
